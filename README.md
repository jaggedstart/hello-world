Starting, so hi
Hi, i am completely new to writing code and stumbled on this site by accident while trying to tweak windows 10 for better security and performance. I am stupefied by the free knowledge and work done here. I would like to learn to code and actually have always wanted to. I hope to stick with it and contribute agreeable knowledge and interfaces. But most likely I'll end up playing league on my free time ^_^
